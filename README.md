# [WIP] extra.css

A Houdini paint library for making your sites a little extra 💁🏻‍♀️

**This is a WIP**

To run the examples, use a local server: i.e. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` and navigate to `localhost:8000`

## Contributing

Each directory in the lib folder should have a properties.js and a worklet file that will be combined to generate the file in the root directory. Run `npm run build` to generate these files.
